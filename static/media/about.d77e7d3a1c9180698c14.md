Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a _Full Stack Developer_ at a tech company based out of Chiang Mai, Thailand.

I'm an aspiring Developer with a passion for writing code and making things on the web look pretty. I'm well as *frontend*, *backend*, *database* and *cloud technologies*. I have always been a firm believer in the human element of design and knowing your audience. Therefore, I strive to create simple, functional and impactful user experiences.  I primarily code in **Golang** and **Nodejs** for backend and **React** and **Vue** for frontend. I also have experience with **GCP**.

In my free time, I love to play game, watch Movie ⚽.
